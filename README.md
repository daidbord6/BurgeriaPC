***The best way to play Papa's Burgeria, now on PC!***

This is a port of Burgeria HD and ToGo! Which are the mobile versions FlipLine produced. It seems as if these "mobile ports" are just Adobe Air apps with SWFs for the games themselves. Using this knowledge, I used the scratch 2 executable as a base (since it uses AIR too), and replaced all the Scratch files with Mobile Burgeria's. Thankfully, it worked! However, I can't seem to get any newer ones to work (Freezeria +), I don't know if this is because they require newer AIR or if it is just because Scratch's exe might be outdated, but if anyone can provide a solution, I would gladly post them all here. 

This should be obvious, but this requires the AIR runtime at https://airsdk.harman.com/runtime.

P.S: This version of the swf file seems to have been modded for infinite money, if anyone has a clean APK (Android App Package) or IPA (iPhone App File) to donate to the cause for the swf, please do, as both of these can be extracted to get an swf!

P.P.S: These HD app archives are hard to find, even if we do find a solution, the only apps I have so far are Burgeria and Freezeria, so I guess I could just use the ToGo! Versions of them instead. Also, ***only on Windows*** i'm not sure if there is a way to run AIR on linux or mac, but it's probably possible. 

(NEW NEWS)
Apparently, while looking at the AS code, there seems to be multiple hidden names in the files for stuff and I will list them all here but there seems to be no way to use them:
